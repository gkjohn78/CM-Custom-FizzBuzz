Goals for this exercise:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. Pipeline the old implementation that froze
    * Modified method to take in a single integer value and respond with string
    * Modified the library to be able to by default set 3 & 5 as the divisors and "Fizz" and "Buzz as the tokens"

 2. Unit Testing and make sure that the 3 and 5 cases always works
    * Unit Testing with XUnit
    * Unit Test for the base cases of 3 and 5
    * Unit Test for customized divisors and tokens
    * Unit Test to check for bad inputs like 0 divisors or null tokens.

3. Make it so that developers can pass in own number and word pairs - DONE
    * Modified the library so that developers can specify their own divisors and token selections

4. Extra Credit: Create a build script to publish for release
